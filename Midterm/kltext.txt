1.Data Science is an interdisciplinary field about processes and systems to extract knowledge or insights from large volumes of data in various forms (data in various forms, data in various forms, data in various forms), either structured or unstructured,[1][2] which is a continuation of some of the data analysis fields such as statistics, data mining and predictive analytics, as well as Knowledge Discovery in Databases.
2.Machine learning is a subfield of computer science[1] that evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence.[1] Machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data.[2] Such algorithms operate by building a model from example inputs in order to make data-driven predictions or decisions,[3]:2 rather than following strictly static program instructions.
