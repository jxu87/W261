    "**What is MrJob?**\n",
    "\n",
    "MRJob is a Python package for running Hadoop streaming jobs developed by Yelp in 2010. The motivation for its development was a desire for a better parallel solution across multiple machines. The goals for the framework are: \n",
    "1. Simplicity and a pseudo-code syntax       \n",
    "2. Flexibility and generality  \n",
    "3. Easy installation   \n",
    "4. Performance  \n",
    "\n",
    "MRJob assists in producing data pipelines and multistep jobs that feed once MapReduce output directly as input into the next MapReduce job, and then submitting the multistep job to Hadoop job tracker. Some other features are an abstracted MapReduce Interface, the ability to handle complex Python objects, acceptance of a variety of input formats (text based, binary with pickled objects), AWS integration, easy to run locally, and a strong community of developers and contributors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**How is it different to Hadoop MapReduce?** \n",
    "\n",
    "Hadoop MapReduce is a framework to process large data sets with programs running in a distributed and fault tolerant way. Hadoop MapReduce is just one framework that MRJob can run on. MrJob is a python wrapper over hadoop streaming API to provide a consistent interface to run programs on a variety of environments, be it local, hadoop cluster or AWS EMR without changing the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the mapper_init(), mapper_final(), combiner_final(), reducer_final() methods? When are they called?**\n",
    "\n",
    "*mapper_init()* is used to define the actions needed to set up the mapping algorithm, and is the called before the mapper function processes any input. This may include loading file information needed for the mapping step. It runs before the mapper function.  \n",
    "*mapper_final()* is used to define an action to be run after the mapepr function reaches the end of the inputs.  \n",
    "*combiner_final()* defines the actions necessary to clean up the combiner algorithms, running after the combiner finishes its execution.  \n",
    "*reducer_final()* defines the actions necessary to clean up the combiner algorithms, running after the reducer finishes its execution.  "

    "**What is serialization in the context of MrJob or Hadoop?** \n",
    "\n",
    "Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes in order to transmit it over a network into memory for interprocess communication or to persistent storage. The purpose is to save the state of an object until it is needed again. Text processing is slow, and incurs extra storage and networks costs, so serialization is method of more efficient communication and storage. The reverse process is called deserialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When it used in these frameworks?** \n",
    "\n",
    "In these frameworks, serialization enables the data to be compacted into binary format so large data sets can be transferred over the network and consumed by various programming languages. It is used between the tasks of a mapreduce job such as map, combine and reduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the default serialization mode for input and outputs for MrJob?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The default serialization mode in MRJob for input is RawValueProtocol (raw text value). The output is JSONProtocol (in JSON format)."

    "4 trained centroids results in a 90.10% purity score, which is marginally better than the 4 perturbation centroid setting. Human classification is almost perfect, which generates the higher overall purity score due to there being many more true Human classifications and having an almost perfect purity score for Human. Only 5 iterations to reach the threshold convergence even with 4 centroids, which makes sense because \"trained\" centroids should lead to initialization at points closer to local minimas."
