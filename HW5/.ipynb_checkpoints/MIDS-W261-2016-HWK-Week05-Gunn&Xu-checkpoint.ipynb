    "\n",
    "A data warehouse is a central repository of integrated data from one or many sources used for reporting and data analysis. In an enterprise setting, it serves as the primary repository of data from sales transactions to product inventories. Modern data warehouses can store:  \n",
    "- relational data  \n",
    "- semi-structured data like query logs  \n",
    "- unstructured data like tweets, titles of web pages\n",
    "\n",
    "Data warehouses form a foundation for business intelligence and data science, and are leveraged to gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace through data mining.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a Star schema? When is it used?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A Star Schema is a type of data mart schema that consists of one or more fact tables referencing any number of dimension tables. It gets its name from the tendency of the physical model to resemble a star with the fact table in the center and dimension tables surrounding it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"starschema.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used to handle simpler queries as the join logic is usually simpler to handle than the join logic needed to retrieve data from a highly normalized transactional schemas. There is also more simplified business reporting logic, query performance gains, and faster aggregations compared to other schemas.\n"

    "**In the database world What is 3NF?**\n",
    "\n",
    "3NF is third normal form, the third step in normalizing a database and builds on the first and second normal forms. It is a normalization process used to reduce the unnecessary duplication of data and making sure every value of of attribute column of a table exists as a value of another attribute column in the same or different table (referential integrity). This is done by ensuring that the data is in second normal form and that all the attributes in the table are determined only by the candidate keys of the table and not by any other non-prime attributes. 3NF is used to improve processing while minimizing storage costs, which is ideal for online transaction processing (OLTP) applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Does machine learning use data in 3NF? If so why?**\n",
    "\n",
    "3NF is often used for machine learning - 3NF's structure is ideal for machine processing. The removal of transitive functional dependency avoids inputting features for machine learning that are redundant and non-independent. Relational databases almost always contain structured, normalized data with indexes, and machine learning in this realm uses 3NF data inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In what form does ML consume data?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Although 3NF works well for ML, ML consumes data in a variety of additional forms. Not all ML applications depend on data normalization - 1NF and 2NF can be fed into ML algorithms, although the effectiveness will vary depending on the algorithm and type of data being worked with. ML algorithms are now sophisticated enough to learn from unstructured data as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why would one use log files that are denormalized?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Denormalized log files can be more efficient for queries that draw information from several tables that are stored on disk and require complex joins to complete, depending on the size and type of data. Denormalization is the process of attempting to optimize the read performance of a database by adding redundant data or by grouping data - it is a tradeoff of redundancy/extra space for scalability and read performance. Hadoop MapReduce for example primarily uses denormalized data that is fully contained in a single record to avoid costly joins.\n"
