    "\n",
    "Big data is an umbrella description for existing datasets or sources of new data that haven't been tapped previously that contain a volume and/or complexity of data that can't be feasibly processed using traditional data-processing applications. Previously unquantifiable and uncaptured data, for example in the form of bioinformatic data or user behavior data, are now being generated and logged at a volume and complexity that exceed the hardware capabilities of single machines. These datasets require some form of parallel processing in order to achieve a throughput acceptable for working timelines in industry. Big data  For example, in the legal industry, there are projects using natural language processing to automate the classification of all legal and court documents produced daily by every local, state, and federal court in the U.S. These documents amount to gigabytes of data every week and petabytes every year. The current existing corpus of documents are in the petabytes. This has become a big data problem because companies in the legal tech space are looking to build legal research and document generation products that actively query these document databases and run NLP algorithms too complex for a single machine to process. A parallel processing infrastructure is needed to reasonably access and analyze this volume of legal document data. "

    "Bias - The bias of the regression model is calculated using the formula (h - y), where h is the average prediction model fit over all the datasets that can be sampled from the complete population that dataset T is sampled from, and y is the true function that describes the population. In this case, we will need to sample multiple datasets from the complete population to determine h. As the degree of the polynomial increases, the model becomes better fit to the data, which decreases the value of h and decreases the bias of the model. \n",

    "Variance - The variance of the regression model is calculated using the formula above, where k is each datapoint in T, yk is the model fit over T in question, and K is the total number of parameters in the model. Variance is a measure of the difference between the model dependent on T with the model estimated over all datasets drawn from the complete population. As the degree of the polynomial increases, the model yk becomes better fit to the data but the estimates become farther from the average model h, leading variance to increase.\n",

    "I would select a model by incorporating either an AIC or BIC metric. AIC and BIC is a method of adding a penalty term for the number of parameters in a model. I would calculate the AIC or BIC for each polynomial regression model and choose the model where the AIC/BIC gain is balanced out by the increasing complexity of the model.  BIC penalizes the model for more parameters more so than AIC, so depending on whether I want the benefits of a more complex model I may use AIC or BIC. Both AIC and BIC are derived from the formula [-2logL + kp], where L is the likelihood function, p is the number of parameters in the model, and k is 2 for AIC and log(n) where n = sample size for BIC. To determine the final best model, I would look at a combination of the AIC/BIC scores along with the bias^2 and variance. I would plot these values for all regression models and observe if there is an optimal lowpoint - if there is a clear model with the lowest scores in all areas, that will most likely be the best model. If the scores are not as clear, I would choose a model based on the type of data, whether I am looking to minimize the bias to get a model closest to the true underlying function or if I'm trying to minimize variance to get a model that would be closest to the estimated best fit model over all possible sample datasets from the population."
